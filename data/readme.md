# Data section

Bronze Layer: Contains all csvs except the transactions table which could not be uploaded due to size. All 8 datasets can be accessed [here](https://github.com/EdidiongEsu/berka_fabrics/tree/main/data/Bronze%20layer)


For Silver and Gold layers, delta tables were the ouput and since this isn't a physical data format, a different format will be stored. Snapshots of data in the code folder readme.
